# Network-Anomaly-Detection
This project focuses on developing a predictive model to identify network anomalies or attacks using a Random Forest Classifier. Using 'Train_Data.csv' with labeled network traffic data, the model is trained to distinguish between normal and attack traffic. The test dataset ('Test_Data.csv'), lacking target labels, is preprocessed similarly and used to generate predictions. The model's predictions are saved in 'output.csv', providing a single-column file indicating the presence of network anomalies or attacks. This solution aims to enhance network security by accurately detecting potential threats using machine learning techniques.
